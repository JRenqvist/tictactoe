# ABANDONED

I was working on this project sloppily while on a plane. I don't have much will to keep progressing and haven't worked on it since.
Didn't want to delete it since it's the first piece of code I wrote while 10 000 meter in the air.

## About
I was planning to make a simple tic tac toe game with an optimal AI.
But in the end this program is acting very weird. If you hover your mouse where the window will open, it will display a classic 3x3 tic tac toe grid. But if you don't hover your mouse at the correct spot, the window will be empty.
